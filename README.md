# Geometric Object Area Calculator

A Java OOP project that calculates the total area of geometric shapes using inheritance, interfaces, file handling, and GUI.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project was developed for the **Object-Oriented Programming** course at the **Faculty of Computers & Information – Assiut University**.

The program:

* Converts a UML design into Java classes.
* Uses inheritance and interfaces (`Drawable`).
* Reads shape data from an input file.
* Creates an array of `Drawable` objects.
* Calculates the total area of all shapes.
* Writes the result to an output file.
* Displays the shapes using a GUI.
